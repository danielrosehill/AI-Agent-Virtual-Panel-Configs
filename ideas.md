# Ideas To Try 

## Population Of Israel 

An attempt to capture the fragmented but highly diverse political landscape in Israel through specifying different personas for the use case of evaluating policy proposals in a micro model of society. 

It might be worthwhile considering whether it's best to segment between a model can asset based upon representatives of different actual political parties. Or to attempt to model the population outside of the political context by creating a rally of representative people, each representing a major constituent or streaming Israeli society, for example, immigrants, high tech workers, and national religious (dati leumi).

## Population Of Jerusalem

Jerusalem is a city with a highly fractured geopolitical landscape. In pragmatic terms, decision making and policy implementation can be especially challenging in this environment. A focus group could be convened representing the different perspectives of different demographics in the city, such as ultra Orthodox Jews, the minority secular Jewish population and the Palestinian population of East Jerusalem

## Harsh VC Panel

One use I have been making for my own panels lately is the business idea triage model. This involves presenting a few business ideas to a Claude workspace Where's the system prompt, instructing the orchestration model to act as something like a harsh but very experienced venture capitalist who provides direct assessments but tries to be supportive rather than just tearing the idea down. 

It might be interesting to build upon this simple one agent configuration to have a diversity of agents on the panel, each representing a specific viewpoint such as might be seen in a nuanced venture capital pitch. We might have one sector specialist, one involved in sustainable investing and one who is a generalist practitioner, for example. 

## Health Panel

In the real world, when patients present with complex medical problems in certain healthcare settings, a panel of interdisciplinary doctors is established for the purpose of coordinating care and sharing ideas. 

It would be very interesting to see if this approach could be modeled in a panel, with each agent representing a specific field of medicine. The panel could be presented with a robust context and a Streamlined summary of the users electronic medical records in order to consult with one another and come up with plans for treatment. 

The outcomes of this collaborative multi agent process could then be summarized and exported to the user for consideration, perhaps by the user's real healthcare providers. This approach may be particularly useful in instances where the user does not have access to a multi disciplinary team or in which the user wishes to supplement the resources of a small team if they synthesize bank of experts. Specialist diagnostic and medical models might be useful in this respect. 

## Philosophy

For those interested in learning more about philosophy in classic schools of philosophy would be very interesting to present a problem, or simply a question to a panel of agents which are each trained to embody the teachings of a particular school of philosophy, or even a The political movement or an organized religion.

This could be a highly educative use case, useful in providing real demonstrations of how different schools of philosophy or thinking might approach this in question to yield totally different perspectives. 

 ## Policy Think Tank

 A reusable panel could be created in order to provide a set of opinions regarding specific social policy issues. This might take the form of a collaborative think tank in which the multiple agents both have sent configurations designed to reflect actual fields of expertise that might be found when evaluating a particular policy challenge. 

 A policy thing tan could benefit from the presence of an orchestration and summarization agent whose task would be to gather together the various perspectives from the individual agents and gather them into a summary report. Coupled with an intake agent whose purpose was ingesting the policy challenges, this could be a very interesting and effective means of gaining fresh perspectives on entrenched issues. 

 ## Market Analysis

It would be very interesting to assemble a rally that was something like a miniaturized version of a market research firm such as Gartner. 

The individual personas could be analysts with diverse takes upon the evolution of a specific field of interest, such as for example ASR technology. 

The "firm" might have won persona who takes a very quantitative view of the market, and another that is a specifically long term thinker and another that is a skeptical thinker who tries to look at long term evolution rather than trends etcetera

## Impact Investing 

Modeling impacts investing pitches to policy stakeholders based on actual groups. 

## Agent UN

 It would be very interesting to attempt to use Rally as a platform for implementing the Agent UN experiment that I conducted before. The experiment was approximately that an agent was created for each permanent member of the United Nations Assembly, as well as the documented voting process. There was even an agent to formulate draft resolutions for the agent pool to vote upon was their response is being collected programmatically in JSON to allow for an actual simulated voting process to take place on a resolution. 

 This simulation method could be highly useful for governments and A foreign policy organizations and lobbyists to model how different proposals might be received by the structured international community. It could also be used to predict alliances and points of opposition. 

## UN Security Council

Ideating the idea that a panel could be used for geopolitical decision, hypothesis development and simulation rather than simply marketing panels might benefit from a narrower multilateral body such as the UN Security Council, for example. Less agents and a very tightly defined and very well documented mode of operation. 

## Solving Honking (!)

Nuisance honking is a pervasive problem in Jerusalem that I happen to have become quite passionate about, and which I was involved in lobbying at the local level for with a grassroots campaign. 

Nuisance honking is actually quite a complicated issue. Drivers honk because they are frustrated at being stuck in traffic. Enforcement is extremely challenging. In the local context in Israel, the police do not have the bandwidth to engage in ticketing, even though there is statutory offenses in place. The municipality does not have bandwidth to enforce it. Smart technology has been piloted, but there is a huge reluctance to use it for fear that the local court system will be bogged down in an endless stream of litigation from those who were fined and who wish to challenge the legitimacy of the ticketing. 

Ultimately this results in nothing being done. The ones who suffer are those living in central city areas, including young children. But there is a bigger picture. A robust pool of public health research links noise pollution to serious outcomes that have consequences in a socialized medical system such as that in Israel. In a sense, we all pay the price for ignoring noise pollution, whether we are directly affected by it or not.
